# Cloud Services & Infrastructure - Session 6 - Productionizing the Application & CI/CD Pipeline in GitHub

Goal: Automate deployments using CI/CD.
Topics & Hands-on:

1. Creating production-ready Docker images for all our services
2. Writing a GitHub Actions workflow for backend/frontend
3. Automating Docker builds and pushes

**Project Task:** Project Task: Teams set up CI/CD for automated builds.

## 1. Creating production-ready Docker images for all our services

In our previous session, we created the production-ready Docker image for our user interface (nginx). Now, we will create the production-ready Docker images for the rest of our services. This means `auth`, `backend` and `processor` services.

### 1.1. Creating a production-ready Docker image for the `auth` service

Let's start by creating a production.Dockerfile for the `auth` service.

##### `auth/production.Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile

```

# Cloud Services & Infrastructure - Session 3 - Frontend & Nginx

Goal: Deploy the React UI served through Nginx.
Topics & Hands-on:

1. Create a basic React UI (starting from a template)
2. Dockerize the frontend & connect frontend to backend
3. Set up Nginx to serve the frontend (production-mode)

**Project Task:** Teams set up their initial repo and infrastructure. Teams start to implement their backend, frontend and database.

## 0. Project Setup, Prerequisites

**NOTE!** Remember to run run the certificates creation for the project! This time we need app.localhost, backend.localhost, traefik.localhost and postgres.localhost. If you don't remember how to do that, check the previous session or `certificates.md` from the project root.

In addition, you should have a working traefik, backend and database. We are building on top of that. If you do not have them, check the previous Session 2.
